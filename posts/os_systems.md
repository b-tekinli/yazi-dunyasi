![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KWezTwLBWKPe2n5S0lWEcQ.png)

An operating system is one of the essential software that makes a computer work. Its main function is to manage hardware resources and create a bridge between the user and the hardware.

**Tasks of the Operating System**

*   **Providing User Interface (GUI):** It offers graphical and command line interfaces for users to interact with the system.
*   **Resource Management:** Efficient use of CPU, memory, disk drives, and other hardware resources.
*   **File Management:** Storing, organizing, and accessing files.
*   **Security and Protection:** Protecting user data and system resources from unauthorized access.

**Types of Operating Systems**

Operating systems are divided into different types based on their usage and needs:

*   **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):** Used for systems with strict timing requirements. For example, medical devices and automotive systems.
*   **Distributed Operating Systems:** Enable multiple computers to work together over a network. Examples include supercomputers and data centers.
*   **Embedded Operating Systems:** Run on special hardware and perform specific tasks.
*   **Mobile Operating Systems:** Optimized for smartphones and tablets. The most well-known examples are Android and iOS.

**Example Operating Systems**

*   **Windows:** As we all know, it is an operating system developed by Microsoft. It is user-friendly in terms of interface and stands out with its wide application support.
*   **Linux:** My favorite ðŸ˜‹ It is an open-source and flexible operating system. It is used on servers, desktop computers, and embedded systems with various distributions. (I personally use Ubuntu)
*   **macOS:** An operating system developed by Apple and optimized for Mac computers. It is good in user experience and rich in integration.

### Operating System Architecture

The structure of operating systems is crucial for efficiency and functionality. Different architectures are designed according to different needs and usage scenarios.

**Monolithic Structure**  
In monolithic architecture, all components of the operating system are in a single kernel. This structure provides high performance but has disadvantages in error management and security. UNIX and early versions of Windows are examples of this structure.

**Microkernel Structure**  
The microkernel architecture limits the kernel to minimal functions and runs other services in user space. This provides advantages in security and stability but may have performance costs. Examples include QNX and Minix.

**Layered Structure**  
In layered architecture, the operating system is divided into different layers, and each layer only uses the services of the layer below it. This structure makes modularity and maintenance easier. Multics is an example of this structure.

**Modular Structure**  
The modular structure allows the development and combination of operating system components as separate modules. This structure provides flexibility and expandability. The modern Linux kernel is an example of a modular structure.

### Memory Management

It is one of the most critical functions of operating systems. Effective memory management directly impacts system performance and stability.

**Memory Hierarchy**  
This is the arrangement of memory layers of different speeds and sizes. The fastest and smallest memory layer is the CPU cache. Next comes the main memory (RAM), and then the larger but slower disk memory.

**Memory Allocation**  
Memory allocation is the process of distributing memory resources to different processes. There are two main methods:

*   **Static Memory Allocation:** Memory is allocated when processes start and does not change until the process is finished.
*   **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Memory is allocated and freed dynamically according to the needs of the processes.

**Virtual Memory and Paging**  
Virtual memory extends memory capacity by using disk memory when physical memory is insufficient. Paging divides memory into fixed-size blocks (pages) and swaps these pages with disk memory.

**Fragmentation and Memory Management Techniques**  
Fragmentation is the condition where memory blocks become scattered during memory allocation. Various memory management techniques are used to prevent this:

*   **Partitioning:** Dividing memory into fixed or variable-sized partitions.
*   **Queue Management (Buddy System):** Dividing memory in powers of two and keeping memory blocks combined.

* * *

### Thread and Process Management

Another important function of operating systems is thread and process management. This ensures efficient utilization of system resources and enables the concurrent execution of multiple tasks.

**Concept of Process**Â   
A process is an instance of a running program. Operating systems allow the initiation, termination, and management of processes. Each process has its own memory space and resources.

**Concept of Thread**Â   
A thread is a smaller execution unit running within a process. It shares the resources of the process and allows more efficient execution of multiple tasks. Threads are also known as lightweight processes.

**Differences Between Process and Thread**Â   
A process is an independent execution unit with its own memory space. A thread is a part of a process and shares the same memory space with other threads.

**Process and Thread Management**

*   **Scheduling:** The operating system plans when and how processes and threads will run. This can be done using priority-based or round-robin methods.
*   **Synchronization:** Synchronization mechanisms (e.g. mutex, semaphore) are used to ensure data consistency between threads and processes.
*   **IPC (Inter-Process Communication):** Various methods (e.g. message passing, shared memory) are used to enable communication between processes.

* * *

### File System

File systems are structures used for storing and managing data. Operating systems ensure the efficient operation of file systems.

**Structure of File Systems**  
File systems provide hierarchical structures used to organize and manage data. These structures are organized in the form of folders and files.

**File Types and Access Methods**

*   **File Types:** There are various types of files such as regular files, directory files, device files.
*   **Access Methods:** Files are accessed through methods like sequential access and random access.

**Data Integrity and Security in File Systems**

*   **Data Integrity:** File systems use various methods to ensure data integrity (e.g., backup, RAID).
*   **Security:** File systems provide security measures such as file permissions and encryption to prevent unauthorized access.

**Sample File Systems**

*   **FAT (File Allocation Table):** A simple and widely used file system.
*   **NTFS (New Technology File System):** An advanced file system used in Windows operating systems.
*   **ext (Extended File System):** A flexible and reliable file system used in Linux operating systems.

* * *

### I/O Management

Input/Output (I/O) management enables operating systems to regulate the flow of data between hardware and software components.

**Management of Input/Output Devices**  
Operating systems manage various input/output devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, disk drives) and facilitate their interaction with the system.

I/O Software and Hardware

*   **I/O Software:** Drivers and I/O control software ensure the compatibility of devices with the operating system.
*   **I/O Hardware:** Physical devices and controllers facilitate data flow.

**I/O Techniques**

*   **Polling:** The operating system continuously monitors the status of the device.
*   **Interrupt:** The device sends an interrupt signal to the operating system.
*   **DMA (Direct Memory Access):** Facilitates data transfer without CPU intervention.

**Example I/O Management Strategies**

*   **Buffering:** Organizes data flow by temporarily storing data in a buffer.
*   **Caching:** Stores frequently accessed data in a cache for faster retrieval.

* * *

### Network Management

Network management enables operating systems to regulate data flow and communication over the network.

**Fundamentals of Networking and the Role of Operating Systems on the Network**  
A network is a structure where computers and devices come together for data sharing and communication. Operating systems manage network connections and control data flow over the network.

**Network Protocols and Services**

*   **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):** The fundamental communication protocol for the Internet and most networks.
*   **HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure):** Used for communication between web browsers and servers.
*   **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for file transfer.

**Network Security and Management**

*   **Firewalls:** Prevent unauthorized access and control network traffic.
*   **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Provides secure and encrypted network connections.

**Example Network Management Tools and Methods**

*   **Wireshark:** A tool used to analyze network traffic.
*   **NetFlow:** Used to monitor and analyze network performance.
